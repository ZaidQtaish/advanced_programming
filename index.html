        <section class='main-section' id='Arrays'>
            <header>Arrays</header>

            <p>An <span class='array'>array</span> is a collection of a fixed number of components all of the same data
                type. A
                one-dimensional <span class='array'>array</span> is an <span class='array'>array</span> in which the
                components are arranged in a list form. <span class='info'>(This section discusses only one-dimensional
                    arrays).</span></p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>The general form for declaring a one-dimensional array is:</legend>
                <code>dataType arrayName[intExp];</code>
            </fieldset>

            <p>in which <code class='ex'>intExp</code> is any constant expression that evaluates to a positive integer.
                Also,
                <code class='ex'>intExp</code> specifies the number of components in the <span
                    class='array'>array</span>.
            </p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>You can also declare arrays as follows:</legend>
                <code>const int ARRAY_SIZE = 8;<br />
                    int list[ARRAY_SIZE];</code>
            </fieldset>

            <p>That is, you can first declare a named constant and then use the value of the named
                constant to declare an <span class='array'>array</span> and specify its size.
            </p>

            <h2>Array Usage:</h2>

            <p><span class='array'>Arrays</span> are powerful tools for data storage and retrieval.
                Elements within an <span class='array'>array</span> are accessed using their indices,
                starting from 0.<br /><br /> For instance, in an <span class='array'>array</span> named "list",
                the first element is <code class='ex'>list[0]</code>,
                the second is <code class='ex'>list[1]</code>, and so on.
            </p>

            <img id='array_image' src='https://i.imgur.com/osGS0su.png' />
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>Array Initialization:</h2>

            <p>You can initialize an <span class='array'>array</span> at the time of declaration,
                providing initial values for its elements.</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>Example of Array Initialization:</legend>
                <code>
                        int list[] = {1, 4, 3, 8, 4};
                    </code>
            </fieldset>

            <p>This syntax allows you to specify the initial values for each element, and the compiler will
                automatically determine the size based on the number of provided values.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Multidimensional Arrays:</h2>

            <p>C++ supports multidimensional arrays, allowing you to create matrices or grids with more than one
                dimension:</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>Example of Multidimensional Array:</legend>
                <code>
                        int matrix[3][3];
                    </code>
            </fieldset>
            <p>This defines a 3x3 matrix which can be visualized like this:</p>
            <img id='matrix_image' src='https://i.imgur.com/TISVpbz.png' />

            <p>These arrays are useful for representing data as tables or grids where elements are organized in rows and
                columns.</p>

            <header>Records(Structs)</header>

            <p><code class='ex'>struct:</code> A collection of a fixed number of components in which the components are
                accessed by name. The components may be of different types.</p>

            <p>The components of a <code class='ex'>struct</code> are called the members of the <code
                    class='ex'>struct.</code></p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>The general syntax
                    of a struct in C++ is:</legend>
                <code>
                    struct structName<br />
                    {<br />
                    dataType1 identifier1;<br />
                    dataType2 identifier2;<br />
                    .<br />
                    .<br />
                    .<br />
                    dataTypen identifiern;<br />
                    };
                </code>

            </fieldset>

            <p><span class='info'>In C++, <code class="ex">struct</code> is a reserved word.</span> The members of a
                <code class="ex">struct</code>, even though they
                are enclosed in braces (that is, they form a block), are not considered to form a
                compound statement.
            </p>

            <p>Thus, a semicolon (after the right brace) is essential to end the <code class='ex'>struct</code>
                statement. A semicolon at the end of the <code class='ex'>struct</code> definition is, therefore, a
                part of the syntax.</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>The statement:</legend>
                <code>
                    struct houseType<br />
                    {<br />
                    string style;<br />
                    int numOfBedrooms;<br />
                    int numOfBathrooms;<br />
                    int numOfCarsGarage;<br />
                    int yearBuilt;<br />
                    int finishedSquareFootage;<br />
                    double price;<br />
                    double tax;<br />
                    };<br />
                </code>
            </fieldset>

            <p>defines a <code class='ex'>struct</code> <code class='ex'>houseType</code> with 8 members. The member
                style is of type <code class='ex'>string</code>,
                the members <code class='ex'>numOfBedrooms, numOfBathrooms, numOfCarsGarage, yearBuilt</code>, and
                <code class='ex'>finishedSquareFootage</code> are of type <code class='ex'>int</code>, and the members
                <code class='ex'>price </code>and <code class='ex'>tax</code> are of type
                <code class='ex'>double</code>.
            </p>

            <p>Like any type definition, a <code class='ex'>struct</code> is a definition, not a declaration. That is,
                it defines
                only a data type; no memory is allocated.</p>

            <p>Once a data type is defined, you can declare variables of that type.</p>

            <h2>Struct Initialization:</h2>

            <p>You can initialize a <code class='ex'>struct</code> at the time of declaration, providing values for its members:</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>Example of Struct Initialization:</legend>
                <code>
                struct houseType <br />{ <br />
                    string style = "Modern"; <br />
                    int numOfBedrooms = 3; <br />
                    int numOfBathrooms = 2; <br />
                    int numOfCarsGarage = 2; <br />
                    int yearBuilt = 2022; <br />
                    int finishedSquareFootage = 2000; <br />
                    double price = 250000.00; <br />
                    double tax = 5000.00; <br />
                };
            </code>
            </fieldset>

            <p>This allows you to set default values for the members of the <code class='ex'>struct</code> at the time of declaration.</p>

            <h2>Accessing Struct Members:</h2>

            <p>To access the members of a <code class='ex'>struct</code>, use the dot notation:</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>Example of Accessing Struct Members:</legend>
                <code>
                // Create an instance of the struct<br />
                houseType myHouse;<br />
                <br />
                // Access and modify struct members<br />
                myHouse.style = "Traditional";<br />
                myHouse.numOfBedrooms = 4;<br />
            </code>
            </fieldset>

            <p>Here, we create an instance of the <code class='ex'>struct</code> and then access and modify its members using the dot notation.
            </p>

            <h2>Additional Notes on Structs:</h2>

            <p>A <code class='ex'>struct</code> in C++ are similar to <span class='class'>classes</span> but with some key differences. Unlike <span class='class'>classes</span>, <code class='ex'>structs</code> default to
                public access for their members. They are often used for simple data structures or when a
                lightweight object is needed.</p>

            <p>While <span class='class'>classes</span> are typically used for more complex scenarios with member functions and encapsulation,
                <code class='ex'>structs</code> are suitable for holding data without additional behaviors.</p>

        </section>
        <hr />
        <section class='main-section' id='Classes'>
            <header>Classes</header>

            <p>A <span class='class'>class</span> is a collection of a fixed number of components. The components of a
                <span class='class'>class </span>are
                called the members of the <span class='class'>class</span>.
            </p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>The general syntax for defining a class is:</legend>
                <code>
                    class classIdentifier</br>
                    {</br>
                    classMembersList</br>
                    };</br>
                </code>
            </fieldset>

            <p>in which <code class='ex'>classMembersList</code> consists of variable declarations and/or functions.
                That is,
                a member of a <span class='class'>class</span> can be either a variable (to store data) or a function.
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul class='info'>
                <li>If a member of a class is a variable, you declare it just like any other
                    variable. Also, in the definition of the class, you cannot initialize a
                    variable when you declare it.
                </li>

                <li>If a member of a class is a function, you typically use the function
                    prototype to declare that member.

                </li>

                <li>If a member of a class is a function, it can (directly) access any member of the
                    class—member variables and member functions.</br> That is, when you write
                    the definition of a member function, you can directly access any member
                    variable of the class without passing it as a parameter.</br> The only obvious
                    condition is that you must declare an identifier before you can use it.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>In C++, <span class='class'>class</span> is a reserved word, and it defines only a data type; no memory
                is
                allocated. It announces the declaration of a <span class='class'>class</span>. Moreover, note the
                semicolon (<code class='ex'>;</code>) after
                the right brace. The semicolon is part of the syntax. A missing semicolon, therefore, will
                result in a syntax error.</p>

            <p>The members of a <span class='class'>class</span> are classified into three categories: <code class='ex'>private, public, and
                    protected.</code></p>

            <p>In C++, <code class='ex'>private, protected, and public</code> are reserved words and are called <span
                    class='class'>member
                    access specifiers.</span></p>

            <p>Following are some facts about <code class='ex'>public and private</code> members of a <span
                    class='class'>class</span>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    By default, all members of a <span class='class'>class</span> are private.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If a member of a <span class='class'>class</span> is <code class='ex'>private</code>, you cannot
                    access it outside of the
                    <span class='class'>class</span>.
                </li>

                <li>
                    A <code class='ex'>public</code> member is accessible outside of the <span
                        class='class'>class</span>.
                </li>

                <li>
                    To make a member of a <span class='class'>class</span> <code class='ex'>public</code>, you use the
                    <span class='class'>member access
                        specifier</span> <code class='ex'>public</code> with a colon, <code class='ex'>:</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <hr />
        <section class='main-section' id='Inheritence'>
            <header>Inheritence</header>

            <p>Suppose that you want to design a <span class='class'>class</span>, <code
                    class='ex'>partTimeEmployee</code>, to implement and
                process the characteristics of a part-time employee.<br /> The main features associated with
                a part-time employee are the name, pay rate, and number of hours worked.</p>

            <p>Every part-time employee is a person. Therefore, rather than design the <span class='class'>class</span>
                <code class='ex'>partTimeEmployee</code> from scratch, we want to be able to extend the definition of
                the <span class='class'>class</span> <code class='ex'>personType</code> by adding additional members
                (data
                and/or functions).
            </p>

            <p>Inheritance lets us create new <span class='class'>classes</span> from existing <span
                    class='class'>classes</span>. The new <span class='class'>classes </span> that we create
                from the existing <span class='class'>classes</span> are called the <span class='class'>derived
                    classes</span>; the existing <span class='class'>classes </span>are called the <span
                    class='class'>base classes</span>.<br /> The <span class='class'>derived classes</span> inherit the
                properties of the <span class='class'>base classes</span>. So rather than
                create completely new <span class='class'>classes</span> from scratch, we can take advantage of
                inheritance and
                reduce software complexity.</p>

            <p>Inheritance can be viewed as a treelike, or hierarchical, structure wherein a base class is
                shown with its <span class='class'>derived classes</span>.</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>Consider the following tree diagram:</legend>
                <img id='inherit_image' src='https://i.imgur.com/d2c2VHS.png'>

                <p>In this diagram, shape is the <span class='class'>base class</span>.<br /> The <span

                    Every
                    circle and every rectangle is a shape. Every square is a rectangle.</p>

                    <li>The private members of a base class are private to the base class;
                        hence, the members of the derived class cannot directly access them. In
                        other words, when you write the definitions of the member functions of
                        the derived class, you cannot directly access the private members of
                        the base class.</li>

                    <li>The private members of a base class are private to the base class;
                        hence, the members of the derived class cannot directly access them. In
                        other words, when you write the definitions of the member functions of
                        the derived class, you cannot directly access the private members of
                        the base class.</li>

                    <li>The derived class can include additional members—data and/or functions.</li>

                    <li>The derived class can redefine the public member functions of the base
                        class. That is, in the derived class, you can have a member function with
                        the same name, number, and types of parameters as a function in the
                        base class. However, this redefinition applies only to the objects of the
                        derived class, not to the objects of the base class.</li>

                    <li>All member variables of the base class are also member variables of
                        the derived class. Similarly, the member functions of the base class
                        (unless redefined) are also member functions of the derived class.
                        (Remember Rule 1 when accessing a member of the base class in the
                        derived class.)</li>

            <p>A <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable is a variable whose content is an address,
                (that is, a memory location).</p>

            <p>The values belonging to <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> data types are the memory addresses of your
                computer.</p>

            <p>As in many other languages, there is no name associated with the <span class='pointer'>pointer</span>
                data type in
                C++. Because the domain—that is, the set of values of a <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> data
                type—is the
                addresses (memory locations)</p>

            <p>The value of a <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable is an address. That is, the value refers to
                another memory
                space.<br /> The data is typically stored in this memory space.<br /> Therefore, when you declare a
                <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable, you also specify the data type of the value to be stored
                in the memory
                location pointed to by the <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable.
            </p>

            <p>In C++, you declare a <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable by using the asterisk symbol (<code
                    class='ex'>*</code>) between the data
                type and the variable name.</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>The general syntax to declare a pointer variable is:</legend>
                <code>
                    dataType *identifier;
                </code>
            </fieldset>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Example:</legend>

                <code>
                    int *p;<br />
                    char *ch;
                </code>
            </fieldset>

            <p>both <code class='ex'>p</code> and <code class='ex'>ch</code> are <span class='pointer'>pointer</span>
                variables. The content of <code>p</code> (when
                properly assigned) points to a memory location of type <code class='ex'>int</code>, and the content of
                <code class='ex'>ch</code>
                points to a memory location of type <code class='ex'>char</code>.

            <p>Usually, <code class='ex'>p</code> is called a <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable of
                type <code class='ex'>int</code>, and <code class='ex'>ch</code> is called a <span
                    class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable of type <code class='ex'>char</code>.</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>The statement:</legend>
                <code>int *p;</code><br />
                is equivalent to the statement:<br />
                <code>int * p;</code><br />
                Thus, the character * can appear anywhere between the data type name and the variable name.
