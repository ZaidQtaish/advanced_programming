            <p>An <span class='array'>array</span> is a collection of a fixed number of components all of the same data type. A
                one-dimensional <span class='array'>array</span> is an <span class='array'>array</span> in which the components are arranged in a list form. <span class='info'>(This section discusses only one-dimensional arrays).</span></p>
    
            <fieldset>
                <legend>The general form for declaring a one-dimensional array is:</legend>
                <code>dataType arrayName[intExp];</code>
            </fieldset>
    
            <p>in which <code class='ex'>intExp</code> is any constant expression that evaluates to a positive integer. Also,
                <code class='ex'>intExp</code> specifies the number of components in the <span class='array'>array</span>.
            </p>
    
            <fieldset>
                <legend>You can also declare arrays as follows:</legend>
                <code>const int ARRAY_SIZE = 10;<br />
                    int list[ARRAY_SIZE];</code>
            </fieldset>
    
            <p>That is, you can first declare a named constant and then use the value of the named
                constant to declare an <span class='array'>array</span> and specify its size.</p>

                compound statement.</p>
    
            <p>Thus, a semicolon (after the right brace) is essential to end the <code class='ex'>struct</code> statement. A semicolon at the end of the <code class='ex'>struct</code> definition is, therefore, a

            <p>A <span class='class'>class</span> is a collection of a fixed number of components. The components of a <span class='class'>class </span>are
                called the members of the <span class='class'>class</span>.</p>
    
            <fieldset>
                <legend>The general syntax for defining a class is:</legend>
                <code>

            </fieldset>
    
            <p>in which <code class='ex'>classMembersList</code> consists of variable declarations and/or functions. That is,
                a member of a <span class='class'>class</span> can be either a variable (to store data) or a function.</p>
            <br />
            <ul class='info'>
                <li>If a member of a class is a variable, you declare it just like any other
                    variable. Also, in the definition of the class, you cannot initialize a
                    variable when you declare it.
                </li>
    
                <li>If a member of a class is a function, you typically use the function
                    prototype to declare that member.
    
                </li>
    
                <li>If a member of a class is a function, it can (directly) access any member of the
                    classâ€”member variables and member functions.</br> That is, when you write
                    the definition of a member function, you can directly access any member
                    variable of the class without passing it as a parameter.</br> The only obvious
                    condition is that you must declare an identifier before you can use it.

            </ul>
    
            <p>In C++, <span class='class'>class</span> is a reserved word, and it defines only a data type; no memory is
                allocated. It announces the declaration of a <span class='class'>class</span>. Moreover, note the semicolon (<code class='ex'>;</code>) after
                the right brace. The semicolon is part of the syntax. A missing semicolon, therefore, will
                result in a syntax error.</p>
    
            <p>The members of a <span class='class'>class</span> are classified into three categories: <code class='ex'>private, public, and
                    protected.</code></p>
    
            <p>In C++, <code class='ex'>private, protected, and public</code> are reserved words and are called <span class='class'>member
                    access specifiers.</span></p>
    
            <p>Following are some facts about <code class='ex'>public and private</code> members of a <span class='class'>class</span>:</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    By default, all members of a <span class='class'>class</span> are private.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    If a member of a <span class='class'>class</span> is <code class='ex'>private</code>, you cannot access it outside of the
                    <span class='class'>class</span>.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    A <code class='ex'>public</code> member is accessible outside of the <span class='class'>class</span>.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    To make a member of a <span class='class'>class</span> <code class='ex'>public</code>, you use the <span class='class'>member access
                        specifier</span> <code class='ex'>public</code> with a colon, <code class='ex'>:</code>.
                </li>

            <p>Suppose that you want to design a <span class='class'>class</span>, <code class='ex'>partTimeEmployee</code>, to implement and
                process the characteristics of a part-time employee.<br /> The main features associated with
                a part-time employee are the name, pay rate, and number of hours worked.</p>
    
            <p>Every part-time employee is a person. Therefore, rather than design the <span class='class'>class</span>
                <code class='ex'>partTimeEmployee</code> from scratch, we want to be able to extend the definition of
                the <span class='class'>class</span> <code class='ex'>personType</code> by adding additional members (data
                and/or functions).
            </p>
    
            <p>Inheritance lets us create new <span class='class'>classes</span> from existing <span class='class'>classes</span>. The new <span class='class'>classes </span> that we create
                from the existing <span class='class'>classes</span> are called the <span class='class'>derived classes</span>; the existing <span class='class'>classes </span>are called the <span class='class'>base classes</span>.<br /> The <span class='class'>derived classes</span> inherit the properties of the <span class='class'>base classes</span>. So rather than
                create completely new <span class='class'>classes</span> from scratch, we can take advantage of inheritance and
                reduce software complexity.</p>
    
            <p>Inheritance can be viewed as a treelike, or hierarchical, structure wherein a base class is
                shown with its <span class='class'>derived classes</span>.</p>

                        the same name, number, and types of parameters as a function in the
                        base class. However, this redefinition applies only to the objects of the

            <p>A <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable is a variable whose content is an address,
                (that is, a memory location).</p>
    
            <p>The values belonging to <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> data types are the memory addresses of your computer.</p>
    
            <p>As in many other languages, there is no name associated with the <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> data type in
                C++. Because the domainâ€”that is, the set of values of a <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> data typeâ€”is the
                addresses (memory locations)</p>
    
            <p>The value of a <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable is an address. That is, the value refers to another memory
                space.<br /> The data is typically stored in this memory space.<br /> Therefore, when you declare a
                <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable, you also specify the data type of the value to be stored in the memory
                location pointed to by the <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable.
            </p>
    
            <p>In C++, you declare a <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable by using the asterisk symbol (<code class='ex'>*</code>) between the data
                type and the variable name.</p>
    
            <fieldset>
                <legend>The general syntax to declare a pointer variable is:</legend>
                <code>
                    dataType *identifier;
                </code>
            </fieldset>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Example:</legend>
    
                <code>
                    int *p;<br />
                    char *ch;
                </code>
            </fieldset>
    
            <p>both <code class='ex'>p</code> and <code class='ex'>ch</code> are <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variables. The content of <code>p</code> (when
                properly assigned) points to a memory location of type <code class='ex'>int</code>, and the content of <code class='ex'>ch</code>
                points to a memory location of type <code class='ex'>char</code>.
    
            <p>Usually, <code class='ex'>p</code> is called a <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable of
                type <code class='ex'>int</code>, and <code class='ex'>ch</code> is called a <span class='pointer'>pointer</span> variable of type <code class='ex'>char</code>.</p>
    
            <fieldset>
                <legend>The statement:</legend>
                <code>int *p;</code><br />
                is equivalent to the statement:<br />
                <code>int * p;</code><br />
                Thus, the character * can appear anywhere between the data type name and the variable name.
